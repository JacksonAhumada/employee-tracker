  ## Description
  I wanted to create an app that was able to create different departments, roles, and employees to create a tracker for a business. I wanted to be able to view each employee, role, and department and view the data associated with each item.

  ## Installation
  The user must spool up a database and will need to sign into mysql. once that is done they will run the index.js file and will follow the prompts in the command line.

  ## Usage
  run the index.js file and follow the prompts on the command line. use the arrow keys to navigate through the menus for the desired action.

  ## Contribution
  to contribute please clone the repo and work in a seperate branch. once work is done please submit a merge request.
  
  ## Tests
